TODO:

### Handles

- Target handles should be on top, and source on bottom.
- For split and merge, use the edge state in a correct way.

- Bug: adding new handle after connecting one does not update the location of the edge.
- Bug: connecting handle to a merge node removes the old state.

### Nodes

- Two or more unspecified nodes cause chaos, or more precisely 'mama mia'.

### General

- Map and items in corner should change placement if screen is too narrow.
